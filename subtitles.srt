1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
First, the cassava roots must be peeled.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Then they are grated with a grating machine, as can be seen here in the picture.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The grated mass falls into a container.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then this mass is filled into a tipiti.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is a sausage-like casing that is stretched lengthwise by weight, reducing the circumference and thereby squeezing out the juice.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They also have modern presses there, as we know them.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
After pressing in the tipiti, the cassava mass looks like a corn cob, but is very fluffy...

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
...and can easily be rubbed through a sieve.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Impurities remain behind.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In the squeezed cassava juice, the so-called goma settles at the bottom, which is used for chewing gum, for example.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Finally, a fire is lit in the roasting oven...

12
00:00:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
...and the dried cassava flakes are further dried on it and roasted for a shorter or longer time depending on the type of farinha.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
By removing the cassava juice, the cassava, even the originally poisonous one, becomes safe to eat.
