1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
First, the cassava roots must be peeled.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,500
Then they are grated with a grating machine, as can be seen here in the picture.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,800
The grated mass falls into a container.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,300
This mass is then put into a tipiti.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:27,800
This is a sausage-like casing that is stretched by weight, reducing the circumference and thus squeezing out the juice.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,300
The modern press as we know it is also known there.

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:38,800
After being squeezed in the tipiti, the cassava mass looks like a corn cob, but is very fluffy.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,400
and can easily be passed through a sieve.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Impurities remain.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:53,400
In the squeezed cassava juice, the so-called goma settles at the bottom, which is used for chewing gum, for example.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,500
Finally, a fire is lit in the roasting oven.

12
00:00:56,500 --> 01:12:20,000
and the dried cassava flakes are dried further on it and roasted for a shorter or longer period depending on the type of farinha.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 01:22:20,000
By removing the cassava juice, the cassava, which was originally poisonous, becomes safe to enjoy.
