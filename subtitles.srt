00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Bro, I'm booking the 10:30 movie, okay?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No man, don't book for me. I've been vomiting since morning, I have a high fever. (English) I think I have typhoid or something, dude.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What, are you crazy? Typhoid? There's no such thing, man. (English) You just need to get out and have some fun.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
(English) Dude, just step out, man. Have a couple of beers, all the (English) bacteria and stuff will die. (English) Has a bartender ever had typhoid? No, because he's always around beer.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Don't think so much. The more you think that "I have typhoid, I have typhoid, I have typhoid", the more it increases.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This (English) typhoid is (English) just a phase.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In two months, the (English) bacteria will die on its own.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
(English) Just last month you got a promotion, no? Then how you got typhoid like that?

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Man, you were (English) enjoying so much at (English) Sahil's party the day before yesterday. (English) You were laughing, you were dancing, you were joking. Now what's this (English) sudden high fever, burning eyes?

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
One thing is possible: (English) either you're smiling or you have typhoid. (English) How can you have both?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
(English) Are you sure you didn't get typhoid because Garima broke up with you?

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
(English) You should get on Tinder. (English) Your typhoid, vomiting, diarrhea, everything will go away.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:28,000
(English) You know last year, even I felt kind of typhoid. (English) But not typhoid-typhoid, like, sort of typhoid. (English) But I fought it. I started jogging.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
(English) Jogging every morning gives you (English) perspective and (English) typhoid goes away. (English) Perspective up, typhoid go-go.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Listen, Nikhil's friend was saying that Nikhil has some kind of fever.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You haven't told anyone, have you? That he has a fever?

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, no, why would I tell?

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
(English) I'm telling you bro, where there's a will, there's a way. (English) What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. (English) The hottest fire makes the hardest steel.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
(English) I will survive! Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive! (English) I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give and I'll survive, I will survive!

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
(English) Is that a smile? (English) A smile has come, typhoid's gone! (English) I knew it!

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Nikhil's friend was also saying that there are special doctors who fix things like fever.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Are you crazy? Do you want to tell the whole neighborhood that our son has a fever, a fever, a fever? His temperature has risen, his head stays hot. What will people think? People will say the whole family has a fever.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
(English) Bro, by saying you have (English) typhoid, these (English) doctors are running a (English) scam.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
They do all this to take money from you. They give it some name like (English) typhoid and say anything. You're educated, right? (English) Don't fall for all this.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
(English) Hey, are you taking pills? (English) Pills are for people who are ill.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Man, you don't need (English) medication, you need (English) motivation. With (English) determination, (English) typhoid will go away.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You know Neha's wedding broke off?

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
(English) Dude, you know Payal? (English) She's bedridden, she can't walk, man. (English) She's only 30. (English) She's been so brave through it all.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
(English) Bro, just think of all the good things in your life. (English) It's so important to be thankful for what you have, you know.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wear this. (English) Typhoid is nothing, there's a problem with your planets. This is a protection amulet. I made it specially for the (English) Libra sign.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
(English) Start doing something that you like. (English) Follow your passion, everyone's doing it these days. Write some (English) poetry.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The more you rhyme, the better you'll be.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
(English) Maybe you need to change your job.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
(English) Maybe you need to change your house.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
(English) Change your city.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
(English) Change your state.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
(English) Change your country.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
(English) Change your continent.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Just change yourself! Then you won't be you. You understand? Then where will (English) typhoid go? It won't know where to go. Where to go, where to go? Sir, I don't know, take a left ahead.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
(English) I think you are overthinking.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
(English) You're over-analyzing.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
(English) Over-hyping.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
(English) Over-hyperventilating.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
(English) Just ovaries.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't think too much.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Just close your eyes and think that you're not thinking.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
(English) Maybe you don't have typhoid. (English) Maybe you just need a long vacation.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Or come for a (English) movie with us. So you're not coming. (English) Okay, bye.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
(English) Dude, guess what? Nikhil has (English) typhoid.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What?

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah. What are you saying? Don't tell him I told you. No, why would I tell? (English) Guys, what's going on?

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:35,000
(English) It's typhoid. (English) It's like any other illness. If we whisper among ourselves like this, (English) forget going to the doctor, (English) Nikhil will think twice before he talks to us about it. (English) Let's be normal, okay?

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I think he also has typhoid.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:05:07,000
