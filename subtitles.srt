1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
First, the cassava roots must be peeled.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,500
Then they are grated with a rasping machine, as can be seen here in the picture.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
The grated mass falls into a container.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,500
This mass is then put into a tipiti.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:27,500
This is a sausage-like casing that is stretched by weight, reducing the circumference and thus pressing out the juice.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,500
The modern press as we know it is also known there.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,000
After pressing in the tipiti, the cassava mass looks like a corn cob, but is very fluffy...

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,500
...and can easily be passed through a sieve.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Impurities remain behind.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:53,000
In the pressed cassava juice, the so-called goma settles at the bottom, which is used for chewing gum, for example.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Finally, a fire is lit in the roasting oven...

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:05,000
...and the dried cassava flakes are further dried on it and roasted for a shorter or longer time depending on the type of farinha.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:15,000
By removing the cassava juice, the cassava, which was originally poisonous, becomes safe to enjoy.
