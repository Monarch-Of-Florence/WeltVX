00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
First, the cassava roots must be peeled.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Then they are grated with a grating machine, as can be seen here in the picture.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,800
The grated mass falls into a container.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,200
Then this mass is filled into a tipiti.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:27,500
This is a sausage-like casing that is stretched by weight, reducing the circumference to squeeze out the juice.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,000
They also know the modern press as we know it.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
After pressing in the tipiti, the cassava mass looks like a corn cob, but is very fluffy and can easily be passed through a sieve.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,800
Impurities remain.

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:53,000
In the squeezed cassava juice, the so-called goma settles at the bottom, which is needed for chewing gum, for example.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Finally, a fire is lit in the roasting oven and the dried cassava flakes are further dried and roasted for a shorter or longer time depending on the type of farinha.

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:14,000
By removing the cassava juice, the cassava, including the originally poisonous one, becomes safe to eat.
